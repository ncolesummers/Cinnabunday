This is a movie night web app for my partner and I. We can add movies to a
shared list and then randomly select two to pick from.

Built using Deno and Fresh. No other dependencies necessary.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
